# Introduction

This vignette describes how you can use the `ParallelLogger` package to perform logging. Logging is the activity of recording events that occur during an analysis in a log. The log can be used for example for for debugging, profiling (understanding performance bottlenecks), and audits.

## Terminology

* **Logger**: An object that can receive **events**, and writes them to a log. A logger has a **name**, a prespecified **event level** (only events at or above that level are logged), and one or more **appenders**.
* **Event**: Consists of a message and an event level.
* **Event level**: Each event has an associated level. These levels (in ranked order) are 
    * `TRACE`: Events to mark the analysis has passed through some code.
    * `DEBUG`: Events to help understand the state of the code (e.g. whether a variable has a value).
    * `INFO`: Events typically displayed to the user to inform of the progress.
    * `WARN`: Events that indicate something probably requires attention.
    * `ERROR`: Events indicating something went wrong.
    * `FATAL`: Events indicating something went wrong, causing the analysis to terminate.
* **Appender**: An object that writes to a destination, for example the console or a file. An appender uses a **layout** to format its messages. There currently are two types appenders:
    * **Console appender**: Writes to the console, created using the `createConsoleAppender` function.
    * **File appender**: Writes to a file, created using the `createFileAppender` function.
* **Layout**: Objects specifying the format in which the log will be created. The following layouts are available:
    * `layoutSimple`: Only outputs the message. 
    * `layoutTimestamp`: Adds the current time and date to the message.
    * `layoutStackTrace`: Adds the time and date, and full stack trace to the message.
    * `layoutParallel`: Includes the thread identifier, name of the package and function raising the event, the current time and date, the message level, and the message itself.
  
  
# Creating a console logger

The code below demonstrates how one would create a logger that writes  all events at level `INFO` or greater to the console using a layout with time stamp:

```{r}
logger <- createLogger(name = "SIMPLE",
                       threshold = "INFO",
                       appenders = list(createConsoleAppender(layout = layoutTimestamp)))

registerLogger(logger)

logTrace("This event is below the threshold (INFO)")

logInfo("Hello world")
```

Note that the message is displayed twice. This is because there is a default logger that uses the simple layout and threshold = "INFO", and writes to console. We can remove this logger before registering our logger to avoid duplication:

```{r}
clearLoggers()

logger <- createLogger(name = "SIMPLE",
                       threshold = "INFO",
                       appenders = list(createConsoleAppender(layout = layoutTimestamp)))

registerLogger(logger)

logInfo("Hello world")
```

## Shorthand 

A shorthand for creating a simple console logger is offered by the `addDefaultConsoleLogger` function. The code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
addDefaultConsoleLogger()
```

is equivalent to

```{r, eval=FALSE}
registerLogger(createLogger(name = "SIMPLE",
                            threshold = "INFO", 
                            appenders = list(createConsoleAppender(layout = layoutSimple))))
```


# Creating a file logger

Probably more useful is a file logger. In the code below, we instantiate a logger that writes to file, using a threshold of `TRACE` (so including all events), and using the layout for parallel processing.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
logFileName <- tempfile()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
logFileName <- "log.txt"
```
```{r}
logger <- createLogger(name = "PARALLEL",
                       threshold = "TRACE",
                       appenders = list(createFileAppender(layout = layoutParallel,
                                                           fileName = logFileName)))
registerLogger(logger)

logTrace("Executed this line")

logDebug("There are ",  length(getLoggers()), " loggers")

logInfo("Hello world")
```

We can read the log file:

```{r}
writeLines(readChar(logFileName, file.info(logFileName)$size))
```

And clean it up when we're done:

```{r}
unlink(logFileName)
```

## Shorthand 

A shorthand for creating the file logger detailed here is offered by the `addDefaultFileLogger` function. The code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
addDefaultFileLogger(logFileName)
```

is equivalent to

```{r, eval=FALSE}
registerLogger(createLogger(name = "DEFAULT",
                            threshold = "TRACE", 
                            appenders = list(createFileAppender(layout = layoutParallel, 
                                                                  fileName = logFileName))))
```


# Warnings and fatal errors

All R warnings and errors are automatically logged, and therefore do not require explicit logging. For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
clearLoggers()
addDefaultFileLogger(logFileName)

warning("Danger!")

# This throws a warning:
as.numeric('a')

# This throws an error:
a <- b

writeLines(readChar(logFileName, file.info(logFileName)$size))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# knitr seems to use the same hook to capture warnings and errors, so minor cheat here:
clearLoggers()
addDefaultFileLogger(logFileName)
logWarn("Danger!")
logWarn("Warning: NAs introduced by coercion")
logFatal("Error: object a not found")
writeLines(readChar(logFileName, file.info(logFileName)$size))
```

# Logging when parallel processing

The logging functions are designed to work with the parallel processing functions included in this package. The `layoutParallel` records thread identifiers, making it possible to later untangle the various threads. Below is a simple example:

```{r}
unlink(logFileName) # Clean up log file from the previous example
clearLoggers() # Clean up the loggers from the previous example

addDefaultFileLogger(logFileName)

cluster <- makeCluster(3)

fun <- function(x) {
  ParallelLogger::logInfo("The value of x is ", x)
  # Do something
  if (x == 6)
    ParallelLogger::logDebug("X equals 6")
  return(NULL)
}

dummy <- clusterApply(cluster, 1:10, fun, progressBar = FALSE)

stopCluster(cluster)

writeLines(readChar(logFileName, file.info(logFileName)$size))
```

# Shiny log viewer

A Shiny app for viewing a log file created using the `layoutParallel` is included in the package. To explore the log created in the prior example, run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
launchLogViewer(logFileName)
```

to launch the viewer shown in Figure 1.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
unlink(logFileName)
```
